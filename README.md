Book-Report
===========

The Sphinx's Princess-A book report by Devin Hayes.
This project means so much to me! There is nothing better than the joy of teaching a child to code.
That is why my son Devin (Seth) and I chose to present his assigned book report in the form of a website. Once I designed the skeleton
template and suggested some photos, Seth took it from there. He did all of the report on his own, a good bit of the html, 
and was able to customize his very own css sheet!
