There is nothing better than the joy of teaching a child to code.\r\nThat is why my son Devin (Seth) and I chose to present his assigned book report in the form of a website. Once I designed the skeleton\r\ntemplate and suggested some photos, Seth took it from there. He did all of the report on his own, a good bit of the html, \r\nand was able to customize his very own css sheet! \r\nTo view the site without downloading the entire project, click [here.](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/11121595/devinHayes/Devin%20Hayes.html)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
