             <p style= "font-size: 18px">If I could change one event from this book I would change who Nefertiti marries. I would make her marry Amenophis. I think what would happen is Thutmose would be envious of his brother due to Nefertiti's beauty. Since Thutmose is cruel enough to try to kill Nefertiti, I think he would try to kill his brother and steal Nefertiti. But he would make it look like an accident, so it would be hard to detect. Nefertiti would find out before Amenophis because of her tendency to wander, and would tell Amenophis right away. When he found out, they would prepare to flee the city. One of Thutmose's spies would see and tell their prince. Thutmose would then change tactics. He would decide that if he couldn't have Nefertiti, no one could and would try to kill her. He would fake Ta-miu's death, and would blame it on Nefertiti. He would have fake evidence and sentence her to death. Once locked up, Nefertiti, Nava, and Sitamun would plan an escape. It would be the same as in the story, and Once Nefertiti escaped she and Nava would meet Amenophis in a boat and they would flee together. They would go to the island where Pharaoh and Tiye were so Thutmose couldn't hurt them, and the story would end. </p>
