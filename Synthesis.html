             <p style= "font-size: 18px">I, a lonely ant, watched as poor Nefertiti was woken from her sleep by priests and dragged out of bed. I saw as her maids dressed her, and a small child joined her. I decided this was interesting, and crawled along beside them. It was strange how she couldn't talk in her case, and when she tried it sort of stopped. Oh right, I thought. It's probably from that potion that she was given last night. I understand. Thutmose gave her it so she couldn't argue and would go quietly.
  We were now in the throne room, and there was Thutmose in white robes and strange objects in his hands. They were talking about the so called death of Ta-Miu, even though I saw her walk by me just yesterday. He pulled out a blood stained dress, which I recognized as the one Nefertiti had worn the night before. There was more arguing, and then a priest led a boy into the room. He talked about a dream he had had, which looked like proof of Nefertiti's guiltiness. I tried to laugh, then remembered I was an ant.
  No one seemed to share my sense of humor, and somehow everyone believed him. There was yelling, crying, arguing, but soon Thutmose quieted it and delivered the final verdict. Death. Poor Nefertiti, but as it seemed, the small girl known as Nava was taking it worse. As priests dragged away Nefertiti, Nava cried out. “Don't leave me, Nefertiti! Nefertiti!! NEFERTITI!!!” well, this is depressing. Anyway, I saw some crumbs. Bye!</p>
