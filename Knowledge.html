                 <li style= "font-size: 18px">Nefertiti – Nefertiti is a strong female lead. She has overcome many challenges, like killing a python, leaving her family behind, and defying the all-powerful Great Queen Tiye. She is also nice and understanding, seeing how she made friends with the spindly, strange looking Amenhophis, and freed Nava from enslavement.</li>
                 <br>
                 <li style= "font-size: 18px">Nava – Nava was born into enslavement. She was a harp player for the dance choir. Her sister, Mahala, saved Nefertiti from drowning but was sentenced to death. Afterwords, Nava lost the ability to speak. She was given to Nefertiti as a gift, and she named her Berret. After traveling with Nefertiti to Thebes, she learned to write and through that told Nefertiti her true name. She is also very brave, seeing how she learned to write when she wasn't allowed, and escaped a castle with Nefertiti. She gained her speech back when Nefertiti was sentenced to death.</li>
                 <br>
                 <li style= "font-size: 18px">Amenophis – Amenophis was timid, had spindly limbs, a bulging stomach, and a stretched head. Despite his appearance, he was strong, an excellent chariot driver, and hunter. He was also patient and very nice to Nefertiti. Did I mention he was Thutmose's brother? He was one of Nefertiti's best friends, and taught her about chariot driving and hunting. It is also hinted that he might like her.</li>
                 <br>
                 <li style= "font-size: 18px">Thutmose – Thutmose was a cruel man who was forced to marry Nefertiti. He was also the son of Pharaoh. He hated her so much he pretended to be nice so she would be more devastated when she found out his true colors. He actually tried killing Nefertiti when she was in a jail cell by putting in a viper, and accused her of killing his cat Ta-Miu to sentence her to death.</li>
